v8boinc-trouble(7) -- User manual
=================================

## TROUBLESHOOT 

* There is a folder `.v8boinc` which is created on `v8boinc init` command. You
can erase it at any time and re-init to restart the project. If anything should
go wrong this is the first thing to try.

* There is a `.v8boinc/bin/jstest` executable. You can create a slot directory
and link `jstest`, `main.js` and `in.json` files in it to run `jstest` and see
the results manualy.
